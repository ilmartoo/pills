# ðŸ§  Knowledge Pills

A simple, single-page application that serves as an easy-to-use knowledge library. This project displays a collection of _pills_ that are easy to browse and consume.

A _pill_ can be whatever: an article, a book, a recipe, a framework, you name it.

The content is pulled from a public Google Sheet owned by me, so a custom backend is not needed.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Dynamic Content**: All content is retrieved in real-time from a public Google Sheet.
- **Intuitive Display**: Presents knowledge links in an organized, card-based format for easy access.
- **Personalized View**: Filter the displayed _pills_ with a list of options that are saved between visits.
- **Easy to Manage**: Add, edit, or remove _pills_ simply by updating the contents of the Google Sheet.

## ðŸŽ¨ Make it your own

If you want to create your own, feel free to check and use my code if you feel like it. This project is tailored to my needs, so if you want to use a sheet of your own, you have two options: making a Google Sheet with the format I am using or adjusting the code and the format to your needs. Either of those should be fairly easy. Happy coding!
