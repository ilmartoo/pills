Digital Signal Processing is the science of using computers to understand these types of data. This includes a wide variety of goals: filtering, speech recognition, image enhancement, data compression, neural networks, and much more. DSP is one of the most powerful technologies that will shape science and engineering in the twenty-first century. Suppose we attach an analog-to-digital converter to a computer, and then use it to acquire a chunk of real world data. DSP answers the question: What next?","programming,learning,dsp"\n"Code a DOOM-like game engine from scratch in C","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7f9p9nDsmc","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GRnwWc2XYAAO6D9?format=jpg&name=large","","programming,learning,c,computer graphics"\n"Color vs. Value","https://x.com/PixelArtJourney/status/1808536098148114832","https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GRk04CvWoAE8kR3?format=png&name=small","To control the value of a color, we need to understand that a color gets brighter the more we desaturate it (the more we move towards grey), and vice versa!
